    <h1>Curator Statement</h1>
    <p>Today, we live amidst the ubiquitous abundance of technology. Our machines orient our perception of reality, rendering possible certain activities while occluding others, all the while unproblematically accompanying our lives in the flow of reality. As long as technology doesn’t break, daily flow continues without interruption, even in the course of an emergent event. This is where all us cyborgs live most of the time as our lives adapt unconsciously to the functioning of the <span class="highlight-text">search algorithms</span>, <span class="highlight-text">recommendation systems</span>, <span class="highlight-text">affective computing</span>, and <span class="highlight-text">social media analytics</span>. These machinic systems open up new possibilities for action, even as they constrain and <span class="highlight-text">enframe our being-in-the-world</span>.</p>
    <p>And yet, it seems we are not able to ‘encounter’ the machines even if we tried. Their <span class="highlight-text">black box</span> exterior obscures the complex movements of capital, matter, data, bodies, and desires, the interweavings of which are the conditions of possibility of a given machine. The digital nature of contemporary technologies makes the far nearer, bringing the exhaust fumes of supply chains, the dirt and blood of rare earth mineral mines, and the political balances of a global capitalist system to the convenience of our homes. However rigid the exterior may be, and no matter what complex relationalities they harbor, machines in our current paradigm are often <span class="highlight-text">designed to disappear</span>. They ought to become so intuitive, functional, and seamlessly integrated into use that we should no longer notice the very technology itself.</p>
    <blockquote class="pull-quote">
        Here, art becomes instructive, able to reveal the interiority of the machines without compromising their ‘magic’.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Artistic practice reanimates the machinic with the unexpected, the mysterious, and the sublime. It opens space for us to discover new meanings, trace invisible mechanisms, and craft <span class="highlight-text">counter-narratives</span>. In a time when dominant understandings of technology are handed down by elite interests to serve their own ends, it is ever more urgent to invent our own ways of thinking, sensing, and relating to machines.</p>
    <p>This exhibition arises from that very impulse: to encounter machines in their strangeness, in their manifold agencies, and shifting manifestations. Encounters with machines is about unraveling the rough and ominous exterior of technologies, familiarizing ourselves to their circuitry, and finding them in ways that allow the machinic to be felt, seen, and heard. The 8 research-creation works gathered here explore the machinic in its multiple registers: as assemblages of interlocking mechanisms; as mythic sites of projection and possibility; and as aesthetic systems for composing new forms of connection.</p><p>Each piece invites us to linger in the encounter: we are not to solve and figure out the machines, but to sense their pulsing rhythm through <span class="highlight-text">play, curiosity, and wonder</span>.</p>
