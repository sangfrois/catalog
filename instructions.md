Today, we live amidst the ubiquitous abundance of technology. Our machines orient our perception of reality, rendering possible certain activities while occluding others, all the while unproblematically accompanying us in the flow of reality. 

This is where all us cyborgs live, as we adapt unconsciously to the functioning of the search algorithms, recommendation systems, affective computing, and social media analytics. However rigid the exterior may be, and no matter what complex relationalities they harbor, machines in our current paradigm are often designed to disappear. They ought to become so intuitive, functional, and seamlessly integrated into use that we should no longer notice the very technology itself. 

And so, it seems we are not able to ‘encounter’ the machines, even if we tried. Their black box exterior obscures the complex movements of capital, matter, data, bodies, and desires. In a time when dominant understandings of technology are handed down in fetishes by elite interests to serve their own ends, it seems ever more urgent to invent our own ways of thinking, sensing, and relating to machines.

This exhibition arises from that very impulse: to encounter machines in their strangeness, in their manifold agencies, and shifting manifestations. The 8 research-creation works gathered here explore the machinic in its multiple registers: as assemblages of interlocking mechanisms; as mythic sites of projection and possibility; and as aesthetic systems for composing new forms of connection. 

Each piece invites us to linger in the encounter: we are not to solve and figure out the machines, but to sense their pulsing rhythm through play, curiosity, and wonder.

Today, we live amidst the ubiquitous abundance of technology. Our machines orient our perception of reality, rendering possible certain activities while occluding others, all the while unproblematically accompanying our lives in the flow of reality. As long as technology doesn’t break, daily flow continues without interruption, even in the course of an emergent event. This is where all us cyborgs live most of the time as our lives adapt unconsciously to the functioning of the search algorithms, recommendation systems, affective computing, and social media analytics. These machinic systems open up new possibilities for action, even as they constrain and enframe our being-in-the-world.

And yet, it seems we are not able to ‘encounter’ the machines even if we tried. Their black box exterior obscures the complex movements of capital, matter, data, bodies, and desires, the interweavings of which are the conditions of possibility of a given machine. The digital nature of contemporary technologies makes the far nearer, bringing the exhaust fumes of supply chains, the dirt and blood of rare earth mineral mines, and the political balances of a global capitalist system to the convenience of our homes. However rigid the exterior may be, and no matter what complex relationalities they harbor, machines in our current paradigm are often designed to disappear. They ought to become so intuitive, functional, and seamlessly integrated into use that we should no longer notice the very technology itself. 

Here, art becomes instructive, able to reveal the interiority of the machines without compromising their ‘magic’. Artistic practice reanimates the machinic with the unexpected, the mysterious, and the sublime. It opens space for us to discover new meanings, trace invisible mechanisms, and craft counter-narratives. In a time when dominant understandings of technology are handed down by elite interests to serve their own ends, it is ever more urgent to invent our own ways of thinking, sensing, and relating to machines. 

This exhibition arises from that very impulse: to encounter machines in their strangeness, in their manifold agencies, and shifting manifestations. Encounters with machines is about unraveling the rough and ominous exterior of technologies, familiarizing ourselves to their circuitry, and finding them in ways that allow the machinic to be felt, seen, and heard. The 8 research-creation works gathered here explore the machinic in its multiple registers: as assemblages of interlocking mechanisms; as mythic sites of projection and possibility; and as aesthetic systems for composing new forms of connection. Each piece invites us to linger in the encounter: we are not to solve and figure out the machines, but to sense their pulsing rhythm through play, curiosity, and wonder.


Play and Process
The Machinic Encounters residency group have developed their projects over the summer of 2025. The group stayed in conversation with one another through phases of exploration, development, and production. The pieces were developed in tandem with collective reflections, in an iteratively processual manner, which is the hallmark of research-creation approaches. This allowed the projects to not only change in dialogue with one another, but also flourish in unexpected ways. As artist-researchers have grappled with the affordances and limitations of machine learning technologies, their works became heuristics for exploring the contemporary cultural moment. 

The works in this residency program explore machinic agents in their multiplicity. We encounter machines as companions that never arrive; as instruments of governance and oppression; as agents that disclose new forms of aesthetics; as mediums for thought and divination; and as play interlocutors. The variety of perspectives that the artist-researchers brought in reveals the unsettled nature of machines, and how their meanings shift as we playfully explore different potentials with them. Grown weary of the contemporary moment in which our machines -as well as us- are entangled in the structures of power that work to advance inequalities and injustices, we find solace in the fact that we are yet to find tools for our mutual emancipation. Living in a society that is robbed of their capacity to imagine, we seek to ignite some wonder and awe against the face of an increasingly constricting technological order.

2. Change the headers in the main page 
 - The map page should first say “Machinic Encounters” on top, and exhibition plan in small font below the map. 
 - text should be introduce with something like : A Word from the Curator

3. Add a delete function for the thought collection in the trace page.


## COMMENTS:
Make sure to apply similar text formatting style that hits the eye, but know that the way it is currently is a tad too much, be more consistent with font
